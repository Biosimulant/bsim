Pack Template moved to `biomodels`
==================================

The pack template (for creating your own model pack / extension library) was moved to the companion public repo:

- https://github.com/Biosimulant/biomodels/tree/main/templates/model-pack

Why:
- Keep `bio-sim` focused on the core runtime.
- Keep heavier model/space content in a curated models repository, while still allowing external model repos.
