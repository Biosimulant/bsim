# Internal Planning Notice

Business-case and go-to-market planning artifacts were moved to the internal platform repository.

Public `bio-sim` intentionally includes:
- core runtime/library code
- technical architecture and API contracts
- public examples and contributor documentation

Internal strategy/business documents now live in:
- `/Volumes/dem-ssd/imp/projects/Nitoons/Biosimulant/bsim-platform/docs/internal/ip/`
