# Plugin Architecture (Deprecated)

Status: Deprecated
Last updated: 2026-01-12

This plan covered an older plugin architecture. The runtime now uses BioWorld orchestration with self-contained biomodule packages.

Use these instead:
- `product-docs/contracts/plugin-contract.md`
- `product-docs/contracts/wiring-spec.md`
- `docs/bioworld.md`
